# confluentinc-cp-zookeeper-dev

A pre-configured version of the official Confluent
[confluentinc/cp-zookeeper](https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-zookeeper) docker image.

The goal of this image is replicate as closely as possible the Confluent cloud
environment for purposes of local and CI testing of internal Stitch Fix libraries.

We will follow the confluent tag structure (e.g. our 5.5.0 tag will be based on the
equivalent 5.5.0 tag of the confluentinc/cp-zookeeper image).
